# Neural Style Transfer 🎨🧠

This project is part of the Prodigy InfoTech internship. It implements **Neural Style Transfer** using TensorFlow Hub on Google Colab.

## 📌 What is Neural Style Transfer?

NST is a technique that takes two images — a **content image** and a **style image** — and blends them together so that the output image looks like the content image painted in the style of the style image.
